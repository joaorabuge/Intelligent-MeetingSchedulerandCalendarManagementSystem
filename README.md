# Intelligent Meeting Scheduler and Calendar Management System

## Software Engineering Project 1st Semester

### Project Overview

This project provides users with a robust set of features for managing meetings and schedules efficiently. The system allows for intuitive interaction, making it easy to plan, organize, and visualize meetings within a group. Key functionalities of the system include:

1. **Add Members**: Easily add members to the system, specifying each member by their name.
2. **Input Options**: Users can choose to provide a URL or upload a ".ics" file for schedule conversion.
3. **Meeting Inclusion**: Option to decide whether or not to include each member in a proposed meeting.
4. **Schedule Meetings**: Simple and effective options to schedule meetings.
5. **Meeting Generation**: Flexibility to generate meetings automatically or manually.
6. **Time of Day**: Specify whether meetings should be held in the morning or afternoon.
7. **Manual Scheduling**: If manually scheduled, users can set the desired date, time, and duration of the meeting.
8. **Automatic Scheduling**: Automatically generated meetings can be set to recur based on user preference.
9. **Recurring Meetings**: For recurring meetings, the system prompts the user for the number of weeks the meeting should span and its duration.
10. **One-time Meetings**: For single occurrences, only the duration of the meeting is required.
11. **Calendar Views**: View combined monthly, weekly, and daily calendars for all members included in a meeting, with the scheduled meetings displayed.
12. **Individual Calendar View**: Access monthly, weekly, and daily calendar views for individual members.
13. **Text-Based Calendar View**: Display the combined calendar of all members involved in a meeting in text format.
14. **Individual Text-Based Calendar**: Show monthly, weekly, and daily calendars in text format for individual members.
15. **Occupancy Visualization**: Visualize calendar occupancy rates using color codesâ€”lighter colors indicate more availability, while darker colors indicate higher occupancy.

### Additional Features

In addition to the core functionalities, the project includes extra features to enhance user interaction:

1. **Back Navigation Buttons**: Allow users to navigate through the menu seamlessly.
2. **Error Messages**: Informative error messages are shown when actions cannot be completed due to insufficient information.

### Testing

To test the project, simply run the `main` function located in the `test` class within the `Menu` package.
